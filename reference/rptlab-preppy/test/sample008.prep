<H1>Preppy Test 008 - Testing Preppy With Things That Look Like Integers</H1>

<BR> This tests to see if Preppy can handle being passed a dictionary
with keys that are actually strings, but that look like integers.
Arguably every top level dictionary key should be a proper variable
identifier and you should not use keys that evaluate to numbers
or other Python expressions; but this at least proves it doesn't
break.
<H2>Expected Output</H2>
You should see four lines of text between these lines.

This should print a 1: {{1}}
This should print a 2: {{2}}
<BR>
This should print the string in key 1, but is plain daft:
    {{dictionary['1']}}
This should print the string in key 2 and is equally daft:
    {{dictionary['2']}}
