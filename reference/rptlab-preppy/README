Preppy - a PreProcessor for Python
==================================


Preppy is ReportLab's templating system.  It has been in continuous
production use since 2000.

It was released as open source code but never evangelized.  We are
putting it out on PyPI now because many of our solutions depend on it,
and this makes it a lot easier to install (e.g. with a pip
requirements file).

Preppy is a single Python module which should be placed directly on
the path (i.e. you access it with 'import preppy').  The setup
script does this, but it's just as effective to grab it from the
repo and drop it into your project.

Preppy aims to be absolutely minimal.   You embed Python expressions
and control structures in your template.  It compiles the template
into a .pyc file.  A preppy template is exactly equivalent to a Python
function which accepts parameters and returns text output.  We don't
both with include functions, block nesting, filters or any other fancy
stuff, because we already have a perfectly good language to do that in.

Preppy is just Python, so you get proper Python tracebacks, with the
original line number in the .prep file; you can happily debug through
calls to python, preppy, python and more preppy.


Currently the docs and tests are rather old-fashioned, because this
dates back to before the unittest module, Sphinx and so on.  We're
working on this.  It also has 'more than one way to do things',
which we will be simplifying and deprecating soon before making it
available on Python 3.x.
